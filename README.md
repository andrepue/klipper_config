# klipper_config

Blog entry.

Welcome

As I struggled a bit with setting up Klipper, Moonraker and Mainsail on a new
clean Linux Mint installation on an used Thinclient HP TC610, I  want to make some notes here.
The official Mainsail documentation lacks some changes in the configuration of Moonraker, 
as well in the configuration of Klipper. To get everything running on the new system was
quite a hassle. This was not all related to Klipper, Mooraker or Mainsail itself, it was
mostly due to many differences between out of the box configurations of the different Linux
distributions, which in my opinion is one of the most problems of Linux.
The Original Documnetation I relied on was for a Raspberry Pi. Raspbian, and now Raspbery Pi OS 
is based on Debian Linux. I used Linux Mint, as I really like it. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu. 
Ubuntu is again based on Debian. So my thinking was, there should not be too much difference
in the systems, but there are a lot, and sometimes only small things are different but they 
change what needs to be done to access certain files, folders and serial ports.

I will therefore create seperate files for thedifferent steps of the installation, with links
to the resources I used.
