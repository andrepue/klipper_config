# My Klipper configuration

Topic of this Repository is the instalaltion of 3D printer firmware "Klipper" for my 3D printer

it costed me a lot of headaches when installing Klipper again on a Thin Client, as they are
currently much cheaper and more available than Raspberry Pis. I had a running system on Ubuntu 
but due to lack of free harddrive (SSD) space I was not aanymore ble to update the system. Also
i found a lot of other stuff on the SDD as the thin client was kind of raspberry Pi alternative
to try out several things, which did not require GPIO pins.
